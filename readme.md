  Link Text Standard Library Implementation

### Welcome

The `wolf` library aims to be a very low-level implementation of the abstraction over programming language primitives. It is an implementation of [`moon`](https://github.com/teamtreesurf/moon).

That is, it implements the abstractions over basic "datatypes" like the string, integer, boolean, etc.. And also more complex but still basic data types like the list, array, map, etc.. It tries to normalize as much as possible to create a uniform interface across programming language environments. It doesn't delve into opinionated conventions too much, that is saved for the [`crow`](https://github.com/teamtreesurf/crow) project.

This project is to be validated against the moon, to make sure it adheres to the API specification. Basic type checking.

You typically won't use `wolf` directly, you should use [`base`](https://github.com/teamtreesurf/base) (still much a work in progress) for writing your daily code. The `base` project is the burgeoning entrypoint for doing stuff with link text.

### TreeSurf

This is being developed by the folks at [TreeSurf](https://drum.work), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. TreeSurf started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/mountbuild) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teamtreesurf), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamtreesurf), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/teamtreesurf).
